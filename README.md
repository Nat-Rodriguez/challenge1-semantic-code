# challenge1-semantic-code

## Task

I have refactored starter code with semantic html in order to make it more accessible while retaining its functionality and appearance.

This includes:

- Ensuring the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

- Ensuring classes are titled concisely

- Ensuring the css aligns with the changed html

## Tech Used

- The starter code was assigned by Columbia Engineering Coding Boot Camp.

- HTML

- CSS
